# security-engineering-tools

A collection of Python-based security engineering tools for automation, detection, and analysis, including hash verification, DNS checks, network connectivity testing, and VPN alert generation.
These tools were initially developed for an OpenSearch‑based SIEM and Jira as the ticketing platform. They serve as a solid starting point and can be easily adapted to any SIEM solution or ticketing system used in your environment.

## AI-Assisted Alert Logic

Only the alert-response functionality in this project was developed with assistance from OpenAI models.  
This was used to generate structured, consistent, and context-aware responses for specific security alerts.

If you do not wish to use any OpenAI‑assisted logic, you can safely remove the alert‑response components. All other tools work independently and do not rely on OpenAI.
